    <h1>Scenarios for the 49ers</h1>
    <p> 
    In my opinion, there are _ possible scenarios for the 49ers, regarding their quarterback selection. Kyle Shanahan specifically stated that Jimmy Garoppolo will be traded at the end of the season, and these scenarios reflect that.
    Keep in mind that these are my own opinion, and these are predictions. 
    </p>

    <ul> 
      <li>
    Worst case scenario: Jimmy Garoppolo gets injured before the midseason mark, forcing the new QB to play, or a veteran backup.
      </li>
      <p>
      Starting the new quarterback too early before he gets time to develop could lead to underwhelming performances, and an overall
      lack of confidence. If the injury is long-term, Jimmy's trade value will go down, and we won't be able to cut him. 
      We would lose our starting quarterback, and not gain anything in return.
      </p>
      <li>
     2. Drafting Mac Jones with the third overall pick.
      </li>
      <p>
      Don't get me wrong... Mac Jones is a good quarterback. However, he is not worth the third overall pick. No matter how highly
      Kyle thinks of him, other teams won't be interested in him that high up. 
      </p>
      <li>
        3. Trading Down and drafting Mac Jones
      </li>
      <p>
      While we would regain some draft capital, it is not worth losing out on generational talents like Justin Fields, Zach Wilson,
      and Trey Lance. 
      </p>
      <li>
        4. Drafting Trey Lance
      </li>
      <p>
      Trey Lance has a very high ceiling, but is a very raw talent. He hasn't played a game of football in over a year, and NDSU isn't
      known for going up against the greatest of competition. With Jimmy Garoppolo leaving in a year, Trey Lance won't be ready 
      for the starting job. He needs 2-3 more years before he can become an elite-level quarterback. If the niners take him, I would
      expect him to sit behind a veteran qb for a year after Jimmy leaves.
      </p>
      <li>
        5. Drafting Justin Fields
      </li>
      <p>
      Justin Fields is an amazing athlete, and a tremendous quarterback prospect. However, he has some technical issues, such as
      staying still in the pocket, and locking on to one receiver too early. Sitting behind Jimmy Garoppolo for one year can fix those
      issues, but a lot depends on how willing Jimmy is to take a quarterback under his wing.
      </p>
      <li>
        Best case scenario: Drafting Zach Wilson
      </li>
      <p>
       The QB that draws comparisons from Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes would be an ideal fit for the Shanahan scheme. 
       He doesn't hold on to the ball too long, and has an amazing, fluid throwing motion. However, it is unlikely that he will fall to 3, as the Jets need someone NFL-ready if Sam Darnold departs, and Zach Wilson is most proabably their guy.
