	<h1> assigned work </h1>
	<p>
	  when i first read fahrenheit 451, i was fascinated by the plot, especially the climax. the story has aged beautifully from when it was published in 1953 (airpods, flatscreen tvs, convertibles, fast speed limits). but when it was assigned to me in school, i despised annotating it and writing an essay about the hero's journey.

	  <br>
	  similarly, when i had to read "head first java" for a cs class, 4 years after i first read it, i hated the writing style, the asides, and even the font.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  i hate assigned work. i just do. i find that i like studying more when i am doing it by myself rather than for school. but i found that i learn more when i am doing it for school, and i am actually able to retain the concept. i wouldn't be able to remember the plot of fahrenheit 451 if i didn't write a full analysis of it, and i wouldn't be able to retain java concepts if i didn't have to complete multiple labs and workshops to get a good grade.

	  the thoroughness and rigor of assigned work may make you detest school but in the long run, it really does help.
