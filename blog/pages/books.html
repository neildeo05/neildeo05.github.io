	<h1> my favorite way to read books about computers</h1>
	<p>
	  i used to read computer books in one single pass, taking some notes on a piece of paper along the way. but recently, i found a way that helps me retain the knowledge and also complete projects based on the book
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> first pass - in the beginning, i read over a chapter and underline text that i feel is important. i also add post-it notes that contain quick notes that can't fit on the page - mathematical formulas, snippets of code, diagrams </li>
	  <li> second pass - after i finish a chapter, i review all of my underlines and post-its, and transfer the key concepts to a markdown file</li>
	  <li> third pass - after i finish the book, i make folders for each of the chapter, transfer the markdown file to each of the folder, then write some code that models the lesson taught in the chapter
		<br>
		for example, i was reading csapp, and for chapter 2, i wrote c code that implements bitwise operations, in correspondence with the markdown file.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>this method helped me for most books, but it can get tiring for books > 500 pages long. for those books, i would skip the third pass, and only do passes 1 and 2</p>
